# Simulating-Recursion-
Using a stack I simulate recursion for in-order and pre-order tree traversals 

Recursion has obvious advantages. It often presents very readable code. In many cases it is easy to write. But sometimes recursion is undesirable. I wanted to practice translating recursive code into non-recursive code. My goal was to use a stack to simulate recursive pre-order and in-order tree traversal functions.
